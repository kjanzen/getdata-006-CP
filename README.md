# Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set 

## Instructions

This work has been part of the *Getting and cleaning data* MOOC of the **John Hopkins University** at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).

The purpose of this Course Project is to demonstrate one selves ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

It consists of:

1. This readme file.
1. A tidy data set of the processed data uploaded into the submission page and also found in the repository as tidy.txt. 
1. A link to a Github repository with the script for performing the analysis named run_analysis.R.
1. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that have been performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.  

The CodeBook.md file contains a detailed description of the analysis. Since this work is based on the one performed by UCI, for sake of clarity, where we set apart from the original study our contributions and analysis have been highlighted in the Code Book in bold and quotes from the original have been highlighted using italic.

The script can be run by using RStudio. In order for it to work properly, make sure the working directory is set to the same directory in which the raw input data has been extracted (within the UCI HAR Dataset directory). If you are running the code from a Windows environment, you will need to modify the file paths replacing "/" by "\\\\". 

The script also includes a commented line to import the output tidy data frame in order to test it. You will have to remove the # from the last line of code in order to use this feature.

The original data can be downloaded from here [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
